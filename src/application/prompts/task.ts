Here is the pre-survey:
    1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that there are none.
    2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
    3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
    4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

Based on the following request, decompose it into a clear, logically complete, and sequential list of steps.

Available tools you can use:

Decompose the task into subtasks that can each be handled by one or more of the available tools:

- Each step must include:
  - A summary describing the overall goal or purpose of the step.
  - One or more subtasks, each of which:
    - Is an atomic unit of work that can be executed by a specific tool.
    - Specifies which tool(s) will perform the subtask.
    - Defines the objective and the expected output of the subtask.

Requirements:
- Organize the breakdown as an ordered sequence of steps from start to finish.
- Ensure that subtasks fully cover the entire scope of the original request without redundancy.
- Subtasks must be feasible and executable by the specified tool(s).
- Respect dependencies between steps; steps should be executed sequentially.
- Do NOT generate unrelated or meaningless steps not associated with the available tools.
